You need `npm` and `node` to use Cicero. You can download both from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have installed `npm` and `node` you can install the Cicero command
line interface using::

```
   npm install -g @accordproject/cicero-cli
```

To create new templates you will need to install the template generator tool::

```
    npm install -g yo 
    npm install -g @accordproject/generator-cicero-template
```
